## Kolme Musaa: AI for creative image composition
Project developed for the Computational Creativity course of the University of Helsinki. It consists of an AI that receives a couple of words as input, which uses to download images related to such concepts and merge them in a meaningful way. The AI learns how to produce art for public enjoyment by using feedback it receives from displaying its art on a website created on purpose.
